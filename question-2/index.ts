// //Question 119: Create a while loop that logs "Hello, World!" 5 times.

// Explain & TIP: A while loop continues to run as long as its condition remains true. Itâ€™s ideal for when you want to repeat something until a certain condition changes.

function displayString(){
    let str:string="Hello, World!";
    let i=0;
    while(i<5){
    console.log(str);
    i++;

}
}
displayString();
